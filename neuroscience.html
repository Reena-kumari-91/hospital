                                Alzheimer's disease is slow, developing neurologic disorder that results in the atrophy
                                of
                                the brain, thereby causing the death of brain cells. Alzheimer's disease is the most
                                common
                                cause of dementia which is a regular decline in certain activities like thinking,
                                behavioural and social skills that affect a person's ability to function independently.
                                In this condition, people have difficulty remembering recent events, though they might
                                easily recall things that happened years ago. Alzheimer's is not a normal part of ageing
                                and
                                worsens over time. People with Alzheimer's often tend to forget their close family
                                members.
                                They might also forget how to get ready, feed themselves, and use the washroom.
                                The disease results in the breakdown of tissues of the brain over a while. It usually
                                takes
                                place in people 65 years of age and above. The life span of a person suffering from this
                                condition can live for just a few years or a few decades. Women are more prone to this
                                condition than men.

                                A stroke or brain attack is a condition in which the brain cells suddenly die due to a
                                lack
                                of oxygen. It can be caused by an obstruction in the blood flow or the rupture of an
                                artery
                                that feeds the brain. The patient may suddenly lose the ability to speak, there may be
                                memory problems, or one side of the body can become paralysed.
                                Brain stroke is the second most common cause of death and the fourth leading cause of
                                disability worldwide. Approximately 20 million people each year suffer from stroke, 5
                                million of whom do not survive. In India, it is a leading cause of death and disability

                                the young population.

                                Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that disrupts normal brain activity and
                                causes
                                unprovoked recurrent seizures. These seizures can vary in time, frequency, and severity
                                and
                                can cause loss of consciousness.
                                Seizures are episodes of disturbed brain function, caused by abnormally excited
                                electrical
                                signals in the brain. Epilepsy is a term used for recurrent seizures caused by increased
                                firing in the brain cells resulting in short-circuiting of the brain circuits. Epilepsy
                                is
                                not a psychological illness.
                                Epileptic seizures can be of different types with some being mild while the others
                                causing
                                spasms and uncontrollable muscle twitches. About 1% of people worldwide (70 million)
                                have
                                epilepsy, and nearly 80% of cases occur in developing countries. In India, it’s
                                prevalent in
                                between 6 to 10 per 1000 people.

                                A headache or cephalalgia refers to pain anywhere in the different areas of the head or
                                neck. This includes the nine pain-sensitive structures, which include the cranium (the
                                periosteum of the skull), muscles, nerves, arteries and veins, subcutaneous tissues,
                                eyes,
                                ears, sinus and mucous membranes.
                                Headache is a common problem and majority of common headaches can be managed by commonly
                                used painkillers. Some with more frequent episodes require prophylactic agents to reduce
                                the
                                frequency of attacks. However in some cases, despite all measures the headaches can be
                                difficult to manage. Pain clinic can offer interventions which can help not only in
                                establishing better pain control and improving quality of life but also in confirming
                                the
                                diagnosis (in some cases).Pain clinic offers multi-disciplinary approach to address
                                concomitant magnifiers/ triggers such as anxiety, depression, altered sleep cycle,
                                medication overuse, life style and poor posture.
                                The term&nbsp;Cervicogenic Headaches&nbsp;is commonly used for headaches originating
                                from
                                cervical spine pathology or surrounding soft tissues. These&nbsp;types of
                                headaches&nbsp;are
                                mostly accompanied by&nbsp;cervical pain, stiffness and are commonly undertreated. Extra
                                cranial sources of headaches such as nerves, joints and muscles can also be easily
                                missed.
                                Examples include neck facet or Atlantoaxial joint pathology, headaches secondary to
                                third
                                occipital nerve, supraorbital neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, sternocleidomastoid and
                                trapezius muscle strain and spasms.

                                Neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that
                                impair the functioning of the muscles. These may directly involve the muscle directly or
                                indirectly by involving the nerves or the Neuromuscular junction (the meeting point of
                                the
                                motor nerves and muscle fibre). The symptoms of Neuromuscular diseases may include-
                                Numbness, painful abnormal sensation, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, muscle pain or
                                twitching (fasciculation).

                            Breast cancer has become the number one cancer among women in metropolitan cities. The cases
                            are rapidly rising, with 1 in 25-30 urban women likely to suffer from breast cancer during
                            their lifetime. This is much lower than the US (1 in 8 women) or UK (1 in 12 women).
                            However, it is much higher than that in rural India (1 in 70 women). The other disturbing
                            fact is that it is rising in the younger age group (between 35 - 45 years).
                            Every woman has some chance of developing breast cancer during her lifetime. The risk
                            increases with age with approximately 77% of women being over the age of 50 at the time of
                            diagnosis. It doubles if there are first or second-degree relatives with breast cancer.
                            However, family history contributes to only 5-10% of breast cancers.
                            Breast Cancer does not spell doom anymore, especially now, with modalities to detect the
                            disease early; however, one should never disregard any lump in the breast that they come
                            across. The earlier the disease is picked up, the better the treatment options are and the
                            outcome.
                            Other risk factors are:

                            Early onset of periods
                            Late menopause
                            Null parity or late childbirth
                            Lack of breastfeeding
                            Obesity
                            Hormone replacement therapy
                            Previous history of radiation
                            Previous history of breast surgery

                            Signs &amp; symptoms of breast cancer include:

                            A lump in the breast&nbsp;
                            Nipple discharge

                            Gastrointestinal cancer is the second most common type of cancer present among individuals
                            and represents a heterogeneous complex arrangement of several disorders and diseases. These
                            are divided into rare inherited forms and more frequent sporadic forms.
                            Amongst the cancers affecting the gastrointestinal tract, oesophageal cancer is the
                            commonest followed by colorectal cancers (affecting the colon and rectum) and cancers of the
                            stomach, and the small intestine.
                            The elementary causes for different types of gastrointestinal cancers vary, but some of the
                            key risk factors include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, increasing age, viral and
                            bacterial infections, chronic pancreatitis, and obesity.
                            Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) cancers include malignant or cancerous tumours originating in
                            the cells of the liver, bile ducts, pancreas and gallbladder.
                            Pancreatic cancer is cancer that takes place in the pancreas, which is a gland that produces
                            digestive juices and hormones. Pancreatic cancer is more commonly seen in older people as
                            compared to people under the age group of 40 years.
                            Liver Cancer, which starts in the liver, depends on where it begins and the type of cell it
                            involves.
                            Bile duct cancer, also termed cholangiocarcinoma, is a very rare form of cancer and occurs
                            when there is abnormal cell growth in a rampant way. Bile ducts are small tubes connecting
                            the liver and gallbladder to the bowel. The bile ducts carry bile which helps in the
                            breakdown of fats in food.


                            Treatment:


                            Treatment options for GI cancer and HPB cancer rely on factors like cancer's location, stage
                            as well as aggressiveness. The doctor also considers the general health and preferences
                            while framing a plan of treatment.




                            Surgery:

                            The main goal of surgery is to eradicate cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it.
                            Operations used for GI cancer include:

                            Curative surgery:

                            Removing the tumours from the site of origin with a margin of healthy tissue
                            Removing the regional lymph nodes


                            Palliative surgery:

                            Surgery to relieve signs and symptoms.







                            Chemotherapy:

                            Chemotherapy is a type of treatment that uses certain drugs to eliminate cancer cells.
                            Chemotherapy drugs travel throughout the body and kill cancer cells that may have extended
                            away from the site of origin. Chemotherapy sessions can be given before surgery to help
                            constrict cancer so that it can be removed more easily. Chemotherapy is also used
                            post-surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain in the body. Chemotherapy is often
                            combined with radiation therapy.



                            Radiation Therapy:

                            Radiation therapy involves high-power beams of energy to kill cancerous cells. The energy
                            beams are emitted from a machine that moves around as a patient lie on a table. For advanced
                            stomach cancer, which can't be eliminated with surgery, radiation therapy is used to reduce
                            side effects as pain or bleeding occurs due to enlarged cancer.



                            Targeted drug therapy:

                            Targeted drug treatments concentrate on particular weaknesses lying within cancerous cells.
                            Targeted drug treatments cause cancer cells to die by blocking these weaknesses.



                            Immunotherapy:


                            Immunotherapy is a form of drug treatment that helps the immune system to fight cancer.
                            Immunotherapy is used either when the cancer is advanced, if it comes back or if it spreads
                            to other parts of the body.

                            Gynaecologic cancer is a type of cancer that starts in a woman's reproductive organs. While
                            they are often discussed as a group, each gynaecologic cancer is unique. Each has different
                            signs, symptoms, and risk factors.
                            The five main types of gynaecologic cancer are:

                            Cervical cancer: Begins in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus (or womb)&nbsp;
                            Ovarian cancer: Begins in the ovaries, located on each side of the uterus&nbsp;
                            Uterine cancer: Begins in the uterus, a pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis&nbsp;
                            Vaginal cancer: Begins in the vagina, the hollow, tube-like channel between the bottom of
                            the uterus and the outside of the body.&nbsp;
                            Vulvar cancer: Begins in the vulva, the outer part of the female genital organ, which
                            includes the inner and outer lips of the vagina, the clitoris, and the opening of the vagina
                            and its glands.

                            Head &amp; Neck cancer (H&amp;N cancer) refers to a group of biologically similar cancers
                            that arise in the head and neck region (comprises the lip, oral cavity (mouth), nasal
                            cavity, sinuses, pharynx, larynx (voice box), salivary glands and the thyroid). H&amp;N
                            cancers together ranks sixth amongst all cancers worldwide, and they comprises about 40% of
                            all cancers in South East Asia, including India. Advances made in the last few decades in
                            all the fields of Oncology (surgical, radiation and medical) have made H&amp;N cancer a
                            better understood and better-managed subject today.
                            Symptoms of H&amp;N cancer vary according to the site of origin of cancer. Initially these
                            may not . Because of this characteristic, patients with H&amp;N cancer often present with
                            advanced diseases - a fact that makes annual cancer screening important in people over 40
                            years of age, especially if they are addicted to tobacco and/or alcohol. The presence of any

                            As its name suggests, this type of cancer affects the production and function of your blood
                            cells. This type of cancer starts in bone marrow which is the integral source of blood
                            production. Stem cells in your bone marrow mature and develop into three types of blood
                            cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. In case of cancer, the blood
                            production process is interrupted due to the growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. The
                            various types include Leukemia, Lymphoma and Myeloma.

                            Neuro Oncology is a branch of medicine that concerns cancers of the brain , spinal cord
                            &amp; peripheral nerves. Cancers of the nervous system are often severe conditions that
                            eventually become life threatening.
                            Cancers of the nervous system may occur as primary tumors or as secondary or metastatic
                            tumors that arise due to cancer that has spread from another part of the body. Primary
                            tumors can occur at any age but they often affect people while they are in their prime. Most
                            primary cancers are more common among males than females, although meningiomas are more
                            common among females. Secondary tumors can spread to the nervous system from another site of
                            origin through metastasis, compression or direct invasion.

                            Cancer in childhood is uncommon. Out of 10,000 normal children, one will develop cancer
                            during their childhood. The initial diagnosis can be frightening and stressful for child and
                            his/her parents. These emotions are not out of place and quite understandable but they are
                            also compounded by lack of information as well as some misconceptions. In most cases, there
                            is no specific reason or cause for the child to have developed cancer as it is no one’s
                            fault, so parents should not feel ashamed or guilty. The good news is that&nbsp;all
                            childhood cancers are treatable and most are curable.
                            The cancers can affect any part of the body- the most common affected are blood, brain,
                            bones and muscles. The familiar cancers include: blood cancers (leukemia), cancers of the
                            lymphatic system, (lymphomas), cancer of the brain and spinal cord, muscle and bone cancers
                            (sarcomas) and other cancers seen in the very young children (embryonal cancers). As of
                            today, more than 80% of children with cancer get cured, depending upon the type of cancer
                            they are suffering from. Like for some cancers acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms
                            tumour, there is 90% cure rate, while that for Hodgkin disease, it is almost 95% provided
                            the disease is detected early and treated appropriately.
                            Children are not adults; their needs are different and need to be treated by someone who is
                            trained to look after them. Paediatric oncologists are responsible for treating all
                            malignant conditions among children like leukemia, bone cancers, wilms tumor, neuroblastoma,
                            brain and spinal cord tumors among several others. With timely, appropriate and complete
                            treatment, majority of children with cancer get cured and can lead their lives peacefully.
                            Information and support are important to feel sure about the treatment. The more you know
                            about cancer, the less confused or unprepared you will feel. Regular parent support group
                            meetings should be attended, which will be an opportunity for parents of children with
                            cancer to meet other parents whose children are either being treated or have completed
                            treatment.

                            Lung cancer is an uncontrolled and abnormal growth of cells in lungs, this growth of
                            abnormal cells do not carry out the functions of the normal lung cell and also do not help
                            in developing healthy lung tissue. As these cells start growing in both the lungs; they
                            divide swiftly and develop in the form of tumors, Lung cancer may spread to other parts of
                            the body if not discovered and treated early. Mostly tumors that are in one place of the
                            lung and not become noticeable to spread are called “benign tumors”. Tumor that spread to
                            other parts of the body through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system is known as
                            “malignant tumors”; usually the abnormal cells don’t develop in healthy lung tissues. Lung
                            cancer is more difficult to treat when it spreads. One of the most common factors that can
                            cause lung cancer are exposure to radon, air pollution, certain chemicals in the workplace;
                            active passive smoking; or family history of lung cancer.
                            Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among both male and female, it
                            claims more lives each year than do prostate, ovarian and breast cancers combined.
